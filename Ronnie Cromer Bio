                    <p>As you can tell by the title, my name is Ronnie Cromer. I'm currently a junior at Michigan State University studying Computer Sciene.
                        After changing majors for the fourth time, I decided this is the right career path for me, despite me being on the road to become a super senior.
                         Somethings I enjoy are making music, I play guitar and sing, and a <em>little</em> bit of piano. I recently started a coding bootcamp that I'm super
                         excited about, I can't wait to see what's in store!</p>
